        <img id="project2-pic" src="./static/images/park.jpg"/>
        <p>The aim of this survey is to explore the environmental and social aspects of the parks, including their location, available facilities, environmental factors, and overall liveability.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The survey collects data on park locations, available facilities (like playgrounds and seating), and environmental factors (such as greenery and shade) to understand their impact on community enjoyment and accessibility. </li>
            <li>The results aim to guide improvements in park planning and infrastructure, helping make Christchurchâ€™s parks more sustainable, accessible, and enjoyable for everyone. </li>
