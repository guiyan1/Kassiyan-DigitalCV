        <p>This research aimed to develop an efficient method for analyzing pasture biomass by integrating GIS and Remote Sensing technologies based on the RADE farmlet. By leveraging Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based RS methods, this study sought to optimize pasture management by providing a better understanding of the resource base, facilitating analysis at enhanced spatial and temporal resolutions.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Utilized UAV-based RS imagery captured by a MicaSense RedEdge-M (Legacy) multispectral camera mounted on a DJI Phantom 4 Pro V2.0  UAV, combined with pasture yield measurements collected in the field over four seasons covering one year.</li>
            <li>Explored the relationship between the NDVI obtained from the multispectral camera and pasture dry matter yield, implementing a regression model for predicting future pasture biomass levels.</li>
            <li>Examined additional factors and used UAV-based point clouds to estimate sward height, improving year-round pasture management.</li>
        </ul>
