        <p>One definition of ecosystem services is as “the benefits people derive from ecosystems – the support of sustainable human well-being that ecosystems provide” (Costanza et al., 2014 p.153). The aim of this project is to use LiDAR data to map the percentage of tree canopy cover in Edgeware.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Used data points classified as vegetation that were at least 3m tall to develop the urban forest layer. </li>
            <li>Reclassified the raster layer of the study area, identifying regions with a tree canopy above 3m as urban forest areas. </li>
            <li>Located north of central Christchurch, Edgeware falls within the NZ SA2 areas and serves as the study area.</li>
        </ul>
